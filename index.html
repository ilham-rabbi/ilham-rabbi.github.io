            <h4>The Boy and the Heron / How Do You Live - Hayao Miyazaki</h4>
            <p>Hayao Miyazaki's final work, this film is a beautiful exploration of grief and also a love letter to 
                the medium of animation. The story follows an emotionally disengaged Mahito who is grappling with the 
                recent loss of his mother and the introduction of his father's new wife. We see that he is plagued by 
                nightmares of the day he lost his mother and how he was unable to reach her in time. As we progress through 
                the film we see Mahito come to terms with his loss, and the changes occurring in his life.
                <br>The movie was visually stunning. The fantastical world Miyazaki crafts through soft world-building was
                 so characteristically his own. The round cutesy Warawara are reminiscent of the Kodama Forest Spirits from 
                 Mononoke Hime, the grassy meadows under blue skies remind me of those from The Wind Rises, and Himi's magic 
                 brought to mind Calcifer from Howl's Moving Castle. All through the movie are references to his past works,
                  which could be taken as an excessive show of self-indulgence, but I'd rather think of it as a slightly 
                  saccharine reflection on his career.
                <br>At the end of the film, Mahito chooses to leave the world of fantasy and live in the real world with all 
                its cruel realities. As he returns to the real world the heron tells him that "forgetting is normal" which was, 
                although a bit too upfront, a strong message.
                <br>I found that the film suffered mostly from pacing issues and poor use of its side characters. Mahito's 
                stepmother was a part of the initial call to action, but her role in the film otherwise was unclear and her 
                presence felt awkward towards the end. I also found that the movie was a bit too forward with its messaging 
                about accepting change. I think the movie was much more about the animation and exploration of Miyazaki's career 
                than anything else.
                <br>If I had to compare it to other Miyazaki works, I think The Wind Rises, Princess Mononoke, and The Castle 
                of Cagliostro were all more enjoyable. The film's artistic feats were not enough to overcome what I thought was 
                simply okay storytelling. Nonetheless, I hope that Miyazaki can achieve his goal and inspire a generation of artists.  </p>
