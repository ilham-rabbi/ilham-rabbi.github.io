        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        <p>I'm Ilham Rabbi, a Biomedical Systems Engineering student at the Unversity of Toronto. I'm interested in synthetic biology, therapuetics engineering, and machine learning. In my freetime I enjoy photography, reading, and watching anime. This website is an introduction to my work, interests, and whatever else I want to include.</p>

            <h4>GPCR Based Biosensor For Detecting Odorant Stimuli</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Awarded $7500 NSERC grant to conduct Synthetic Biology research under the supervision of Professor Michael Garton,
                        Synthetic Biology Research Chair of Canada.</li>
                <li>Worked to develop a novel GPCR-based biosensor with an endogenous stimulation reporter mechanism.</li>
                <li>Performed PCR amplification and Goldengate cloning to assemble olfactory receptor genes with the genetic components
                        necessary for transducing odorant stimulation to fluorescent signal.</li>
                <li>Transfected HEK293T derived HANA3A cells with engineered plasmids and culture 14 unique, stable monoclonal and
                    polyclonal cell lines.</li>
                <li>Verified surface expression and functionality of engineered fusion protein complexes with SDS-PAGE, Western Blot,
                    Immunostaining, and Potassium Assay.</li>

            <h4>Improving RAW Mass Spec Data Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Deployed a novel comet-based RAW Mass Spec data-processing pipeline for improved proteomics data analysis using
                    both Python Pandas and R.</li>
                <li>Conducted a comparative study of the existing and new pipelines to determine if the facility should adopt a new
                    data-processing pipeline for client projects.</li>
                <li>Engaged with investigators at labs, in and outside of the hospital, to present the results of my analyses.</li>
                <li>Deployed an automated quality control framework to monitor the data quality of four mass spectrometers at all times.</li>
                <li>Presented study findings at The Hospital for Sick Children SSuRE Symposium and at the University of Toronto
                    Undergraduate Engineering Research Day (UnERD) Conference 2022.</li>
